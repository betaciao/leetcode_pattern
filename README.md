# Leetcode Patterns Journey

Welcome to my Leetcode Patterns Journey repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I work through the Sean Prashad's problem sets. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of various algorithms and data structures. I was inspired by a comment in this reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/shi9y9/salary_before_and_after_leetcode/

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document my solutions to the Sean Prasah Leetcode Patterns problems.
- Track my progress and reflect on the learning process.
- Share my solutions with others who are also working through the Sean Prashad Leetcode Patterns problems.
